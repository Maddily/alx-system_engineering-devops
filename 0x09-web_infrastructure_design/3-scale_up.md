## Description

This is a scaled-up web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

## Specifications and Details

#### Additional (fourth) server
Adding a fourth server improves scalability and distributes the workload, enhancing the system's capacity to handle more traffic and providing redundancy.

#### Additional load balancer
Adding another load balancer increases redundancy and reliability, ensuring continuous availability and improved fault tolerance in case one load balancer fails.

#### Splitting components (web server, application server, database) among servers
Splitting components among different servers enhances scalability, allows for optimized resource allocation, and enables independent scaling of each component based on its specific resource requirements. This modular approach improves performance, flexibility, and the ability to scale horizontally.
