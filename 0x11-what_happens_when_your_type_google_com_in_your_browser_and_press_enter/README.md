# üåê What Happens When You Type [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) in Your Browser and Press Enter?

Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when you hit Enter after typing a URL into your browser? Let's take a journey through the intricate process of web browsing to uncover the technologies and protocols at play.

## URL Parsing
When you input the URL [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com), your browser recognizes it as a URL and aims to visit it.

## Protocol
The use of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) signals the need for a secure connection to a server via port 443.

## IP Address Lookup
While your browser knows the domain name (google.com), it requires the server's IP address. It first checks its cache and the operating system's hosts file before proceeding to DNS lookup.

## DNS Lookup
If the IP address isn't found locally, your browser initiates DNS lookup, sending a request to the DNS provider to resolve google.com's IP address.

## Firewall
Before establishing the connection, your browser may encounter a firewall, which inspects outgoing connection requests to ensure compliance with security policies.

## TCP/IP Connection
Armed with the IP address and port, your browser establishes a TCP/IP connection, facilitating reliable communication over the internet.

## Load Balancer
Companies like Google employ load balancers to distribute incoming requests among thousands of servers, ensuring high performance and quick response times.

## HTTPS/SSL
A secure connection is initiated using HTTPS, encrypting data exchanged between your browser and the server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

## Web Server
Your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which processes it. The web server serves static content, executes server-side scripts, and manages client connections.

## Application Server
For dynamic content, the application server executes server-side code, interacts with databases, and handles application logic.

## Database
Dynamic content retrieval involves querying databases, which store structured data, delivering dynamic and data-driven content to users.

## Conclusion
Navigating the web involves a complex interplay of technologies and protocols, ensuring secure and efficient content delivery. Understanding these processes provides valuable insights into the digital landscape shaping our online experiences.

Next time you type [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) and press Enter, remember the intricate journey your request takes through the vast network of servers, protocols, and systems, all working tirelessly to bring you the information you seek.

Happy browsing!
